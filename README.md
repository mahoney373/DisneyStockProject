# DisneyStockProject
A data analysis project on the short term changes in Disney stock prices before and after a movie is released.
This project was done in R studio. 
The DisneyStockProject.zip file contains everything needed to produce the final document which I have included in both a pdf and html format.
The code used for the project can be found in the appendix of the DisneyStockProject.Rmd file.
